# CS 170 Project Spring 2020

Files:
- `parse.py`: functions to read/write inputs and outputs
- `solver.py`: main solver program for the problem
- `solver.ipynb`: helper file that invokes solver.py on an array of inputs
- `utils.py`: contains functions to compute cost and validate NetworkX graphs

Run `python solver.py` to execute the solver on all files after extracting them to `/inputs`. 
Change the `h=` parameters of `spdt` and `msdt` functions to try different heuristics.
